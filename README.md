BooksApp - iOS version
==========================================



How to Run
----------

1. Clone the repository and open the Xcode project.
2. Add your Parse application id and client key in `AppDelegate.m`. I have added mine anyways. 
3. Setup your Facebook and Twitter keys as described in our [iOS Guide](https://parse.com/docs/ios_guide#fbusers), if you want to have them linked. 
4. Run it, it should not have any issues.
